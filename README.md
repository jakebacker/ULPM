# ULPM
A truly Unified Linux Package Manager.

ULPM was created with knowing that there is no package manager for linux that every distro uses. ULPM combines many package managers into one making it easy to learn and remember the commands. ULPM combines the simplicity of apt and the power of pacman or rpm.

# Build Instructions
