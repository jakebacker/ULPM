ULPM combines many package managers into one making it easy to learn and remember the commands. ULPM combines the simplicity of apt and the power of pacman.\r\n\r\n# Current State\r\nRight now, ULPM does not work consistently and it not complete but it does allow for one set of commands to work for every distro\r\n",
